# Puppeteer

A Model Context Protocol server that provides browser automation capabilities using Puppeteer. This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages, take screenshots, and execute JavaScript in a real browser environment.

## Components

### Tools

- **puppeteer_navigate**

  - Navigate to any URL in the browser
  - Inputs:
    - `url` (string, required): URL to navigate to
    - `launchOptions` (object, optional): PuppeteerJS LaunchOptions. Default null. If changed and not null, browser restarts. Example: `{ headless: true, args: ['--user-data-dir="C:/Data"'] }`
    - `allowDangerous` (boolean, optional): Allow dangerous LaunchOptions that reduce security. When false, dangerous args like `--no-sandbox`, `--disable-web-security` will throw errors. Default false.

- **puppeteer_screenshot**

  - Capture screenshots of the entire page or specific elements
  - Inputs:
    - `name` (string, required): Name for the screenshot
    - `selector` (string, optional): CSS selector for element to screenshot
    - `width` (number, optional, default: 800): Screenshot width
    - `height` (number, optional, default: 600): Screenshot height

- **puppeteer_click**

  - Click elements on the page
  - Input: `selector` (string): CSS selector for element to click

- **puppeteer_hover**

  - Hover elements on the page
  - Input: `selector` (string): CSS selector for element to hover

- **puppeteer_fill**

  - Fill out input fields
  - Inputs:
    - `selector` (string): CSS selector for input field
    - `value` (string): Value to fill

- **puppeteer_select**

  - Select an element with SELECT tag
  - Inputs:
    - `selector` (string): CSS selector for element to select
    - `value` (string): Value to select

### Resources

The server provides access to two types of resources:

1. **Console Logs** (`console://logs`)

   - Browser console output in text format
   - Includes all console messages from the browser

2. **Screenshots** (`screenshot://<name>`)
   - PNG images of captured screenshots
   - Accessible via the screenshot name specified during capture

## Key Features

- Browser automation
- Console log monitoring
- Screenshot capabilities
- JavaScript execution
- Basic web interaction (navigation, clicking, form filling)
- Customizable Puppeteer launch options

## Configuration to use Puppeteer Server

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the Puppeter server:

### Docker

**NOTE** The docker implementation will use headless chromium, where as the NPX version will open a browser window.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "puppeteer": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--init",
        "-e",
        "DOCKER_CONTAINER=true",
        "mcp/puppeteer"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### NPX

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "puppeteer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage with VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons below...

For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.

For NPX installation (opens a browser window):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "puppeteer": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Docker installation (uses headless chromium):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "puppeteer": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "--init",
          "-e",
          "DOCKER_CONTAINER=true",
          "mcp/puppeteer"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Launch Options

You can customize Puppeteer's browser behavior in two ways:

1. **Environment Variable**: Set `PUPPETEER_LAUNCH_OPTIONS` with a JSON-encoded string in the MCP configuration's `env` parameter:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mcp-puppeteer": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"],
         "env": {
           "PUPPETEER_LAUNCH_OPTIONS": "{ \"headless\": false, \"executablePath\": \"C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe\", \"args\": [] }",
           "ALLOW_DANGEROUS": "true"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Tool Call Arguments**: Pass `launchOptions` and `allowDangerous` parameters to the `puppeteer_navigate` tool:

   ```json
   {
     "url": "https://example.com",
     "launchOptions": {
       "headless": false,
       "defaultViewport": { "width": 1280, "height": 720 }
     }
   }
   ```

## Build

Docker build:

```bash
docker build -t mcp/puppeteer -f src/puppeteer/Dockerfile .
```
